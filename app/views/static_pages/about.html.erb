                <p>Family AIDS Initiative Response is a local NGO in Kenya addresses the challenges faced by children who have either been orphaned by AIDS or live with parents who are affected from AIDS-related illnesses.We are involved in implementing the Preventing Orphaning Initiative (TPOI) a programme funded by Family Health International and AphiaPlus.

The programme also incorporates Linkages across the Continuum of HIV Services for Key Populations Affected by HIV (LINKAGES), we conduct a range of activities to reduce HIV transmission among key populations — sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender persons and people who inject drugs — and to improve their enrollment and retention in care</p>
